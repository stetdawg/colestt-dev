Router
----------
Single-page applications are all the rage these days. These are web 
pages that load once, and when the user clicks on a link or a button, 
JavaScript running on the page updates the address bar, but the web page
 is not refreshed. Management of the address bar is done by something called a router.

The most popular router in the React ecosystem is react-router. 
If youâ€™re building a single-page application, use it unless you have a good reason not to.
