Available in two hardnesses of sponge. Alpha version is 41deg, Delta is 35. The true strength of Illumina rubber lies in its control while countering or blocking heavy topspin. We're transitioning all Air rubbers to 1.7, 1.9, 2.1. New sponge is red."

The topsheet isn't sticky at all after initial use but is grippy. It seems people who used Japanese rubbers prefer defender, and I've had comments that it plays best with the plastic balls. It isn't slow and really shouldn't be named Defender. I'm told the better translation was \"guardian\" or \"shield\". NOW IN 0.6 too!"

Sponge is tuned and has the plastic painted onto the sponge to seal it in, much like the Galaxy and other tuned stuff, but this does seem to be from a different manufacturer based on the finish. Sponges seeme a little thinner than other 2.15's I've seen, especially given the tuning. Anyway, I was impressed enough to stock it. The neo are lighter than most tuned rubbers, too. H3 has a semi-tacky top, not terribly thick or heavy, especially compared to their traditional counterparts.\nH2 is a harder, tackier, more traditional Chinese topsheet.\nTG3 is a little less tacky, more often used for backhand. - OUT OF STOCK TG3 Neo black (regular below)."
